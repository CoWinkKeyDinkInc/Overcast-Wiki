      <h2>Capture the Wool (CTW)</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>The objective of these maps are to go to the other team`s side, and get the wool in their wool rooms, (which are filled with special items so you can escape)and run back to your side to place the wool. Every CTW map in rotations (Maps that are being played in public) are 2 wool or 3 wool maps. You must defend your sides`s wool and at the same time capture the other team`s wool. I find it more difficult than any other gamemode. You can join mid-game and there is NOT a time limit.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="tab-pane" id="tab2">
     <h2>Destroy the Monument (DTM)</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>DTM`s usually much longer lasting then TDM`s. Each team has a monument made out of a certain material. The objective of these maps are to go and destroy the other teams monument to claim victory. Note that you CAN join mid-game for this map (I heard that some people think they cannot). There isn't a time limit either.</p>
    </div>
      <div class="tab-pane" id="tab3">
     <h2>Destroy the Core (DTC)</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>This gamemode is A LOT alike DTM. The goal is similar, except each team has a core made of a certain material. There is lava in these cores and you must destroy the core until the lava flows out of it to the specified area. Remember there IS NO time limit for these maps and you CAN join mid-game. After 15 minutes, the cores materials turn into gold, and after 20 minutes into glass IF the XML specifies so.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="tab-pane" id="tab4">
     <h2>Team Death Match (TDM)</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>Team Death Match is basically when you KILL PEOPLE! You are sorted into a team and you spawn with something simple items, then with those items you must get the most points for your team. Some maps (BlockBlock) have a scorebox, which is where you CAN (not must) go in to score extra points, leading your team to victory. There must a time cap for these maps.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="tab-pane" id="tab5">
     <h2>Blitz</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>Blitz is a like TDM, except you only get 1 life, and there are NO scoreboxes. You must eliminate the other team before time runs out. You cannot join mid-game either. It IS NOT a 1-hit kill though, and you must kill people the old fashioned way.</p>
    </div>
      <div class="tab-pane" id="tab6">
     <h2>Rage</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>Just like Blitz except for one thing. Everything is one hit kill. 1 hit kill bow and 1 hit kill sword</p>
    </div>
      <div class="tab-pane" id="tab7">
     <h2>King Of the Hill (KotH)</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>A map almost always consisting of a symmetrical square or other shape where there are 2 bases.  However, the players are given supplies the moment they spawn, so there is no need to provide supplies.  The goal is to control the area designated by the map designer for a set amount of time by standing inside of it, keeping the enemy out. There is no given time limit unless specified. This gamemode stopped being supported in PGM 2.0 update. But then it was re-implimented after the newest administrator - YukonAppleGeek posted the issue on Github. You may join mid-game. There is a time limit and you must defend and get most control points in that time, or keep all control points for a certain amount of time.</p>
    </div>
     <div class="tab-pane" id="tab8">
     <h2>Ghost Squadron (By SethBling)</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>GS is basically when you spawn, with a chosen kit, and are invisible trying to kill other invisible people on the other team. Its weird! The main idea behind these maps is to find ways of detecting invisible players and killing them. A big part of these maps is the terrain. Symmetry is not AS important as other maps. Do /classes to see a list of classes, and /class (class name here) to change a class. Note that you can only change classes before game, and that you cannot join mid-game and must wait until the next map if you do.</p>
